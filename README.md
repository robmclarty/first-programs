A few of the first programs I ever wrote, using the Turing language, back in 
high school. A lot of those programs were lost, but I discovered a few recently 
and put them here.

I honestly don't know if these even have all their dependencies. I just thought
it would be fun to share some stuff I wrote a long time ago before I knew the
difference between an object-oriented and procedural.
